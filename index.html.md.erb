This tutorial will have you deploying a PHP app in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how it all works, so you can make the most out of <%= vars.product_full %>.

The tutorial assumes that you have an <a href="https://console.developer.swisscom.com" target="_blank"><%= vars.product_short %> account</a>, and that you have <a href="https://secure.php.net/manual/en/install.php" target="_blank">PHP</a> and <a href="https://getcomposer.org/download/" target="_blank">Composer</a> installed locally.

Furthermore, you must have a first Cloud Foundry <a href="../concepts/roles.html#orgs" target="_blank">Organization</a> and <a href="../concepts/roles.html#spaces" target="_blank">Space</a> to push your apps to. In case you don't have that yet, please follow the <a href="https://console.developer.swisscom.com" target="_blank">tutorials in the web console</a> before returning here.
