<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the "my-random-hostname" with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your app will be reached from and it has to be globally unique so be creative. The `-m 128M` tells Cloud Foundry to use 128MB of memory for our app which should be plenty.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-php-app -m 128M -n my-random-hostname

</pre>

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-php-app
Showing health and status for app my-php-app in org MyOrg / space MySpace as user@mydomain.com...
OK

</pre>

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
